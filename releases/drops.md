# Delivery Milestones for Radix Public Network 1 (RPN-1)

Last updated: Friday, Dec 18, 2020

For folks looking for a higher-level roadmap of our overall journey to
a massively scaleable public network (releases RPN-1, RPN-2 and RPN-3),
please check [here](https://github.com/radixdlt/docs/blob/master/releases/consensus-roadmap.md).
This document shows the status of the steps we are taking to reach the
first of our higher-level milestones, RPN-1.

When we looked at our development plan for our first public network (RPN-1),
we decided to adopt an approach that would have four major milestones,
which we are calling "drops".

The interim milestones will help us track progress and focus on
achieving outcomes as well as allowing us to move from one working system
to another, avoiding the risk of a "big-bang" integration effort at the end
of a substantial development effort.

I plan to add âœ… check marks, together with the name of the release branch
the feature can be found in once functionality has been implemented and is
available.  Right now we are planning to cut a release branch for completed
features at the end of each 3-week sprint.

I'll use ðŸ¤” to show which features are work-in-progress.

## First drop (done!) âœ…
- Basic consensus âœ…
- Basic mempool âœ…
- Basic client functionality through simple explorer âœ…
- No Sybil protection âœ…
- Fixed validator list at system start âœ…

## Second drop âœ…
- Improved consensus functionality âœ…
- Improved mempool âœ…
- Proof of Stake Sybil protection âœ…
- Validator registration and unregistration âœ…
- Basic fees âœ…
- System testing âœ…

## Third drop ðŸ¤”
