# Delivery Milestones for Radix Public Network 1 (RPN-1)

Last updated: Thursday, February 27, 2020

When we looked at our development plan for our first public network (RPN-1),
we decided to adopt an approach that would have four major milestones,
which we are calling "drops".

The interim milestones will help us both track progress and focus on
achieving outcomes as well as allowing us to move from one working system
to another, avoiding the risk of a "big-bang" integration effort at the end
of a substantial development effort.

## First drop
- Basic consensus
- Basic mempool
- Basic client functionality through simple explorer
- No Sybil protection
- Fixed validator list at genesis

## Second drop
- Improved consensus functionality
- Improved mempool
- Proof of Stake Sybil protection
- Validator registration and unregistration
- Basic fees

## Third drop
- Distributed Proof of Stake implementation
- Finalised fees and rewards
- Desktop wallet
- Exchange integration starts

## Fourth drop
- Token vesting and Explorer implemented
- Exchange integration completed
