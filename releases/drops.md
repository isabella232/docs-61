# Delivery Milestones for Radix Public Network 1 (Olympia)

Last updated: Friday, January 22, 2021

This document shows the status of the steps we are taking to reach the
first of our mainnet releases of the Radix public network: Olympia (also called RPN-1).

For folks looking for information about our roadmap of Cerberus consensus development,
please check [here](https://github.com/radixdlt/docs/blob/master/releases/consensus-roadmap.md).

When we looked at our development plan for our first public network (Olympia),
we decided to adopt an approach that would have four major milestones,
which we are calling "drops".

The interim milestones will help us track progress and focus on
achieving outcomes as well as allowing us to move from one working system
to another, avoiding the risk of a "big-bang" integration effort at the end
of a substantial development effort.

I plan to add âœ… check marks, together with the name of the release branch
the feature can be found in once functionality has been implemented and is
available.  Right now we are planning to cut a release branch for completed
features at the end of each 3-week sprint.

I'll use ðŸ¤” to show which features are work-in-progress.
