# Delivery Milestones for Radix Public Network 1 (RPN-1)

Last updated: Friday, March 3, 2020

(A consensus roadmap for RPN-1, RPN-2, and RPN-3 can be found [here](https://github.com/radixdlt/docs/blob/master/releases/consensus-roadmap.md).)

When we looked at our development plan for our first public network (RPN-1),
we decided to adopt an approach that would have four major milestones,
which we are calling "drops".

The interim milestones will help us track progress and focus on
achieving outcomes as well as allowing us to move from one working system
to another, avoiding the risk of a "big-bang" integration effort at the end
of a substantial development effort.

I plan to add âœ… check marks, together with the name of the release branch
the feature can be found in once functionality has been implemented and is
available.  Right now we are planning to cut a release branch for completed
features at the end of each 3-week sprint.

I'll use ðŸ¤” to show which features are work-in-progress.

## First drop
- Basic consensus ðŸ¤”
- Basic mempool ðŸ¤”
- Basic client functionality through simple explorer ðŸ¤”
- No Sybil protection
- Fixed validator list at genesis

## Second drop

- Improved mempool
- Proof of Stake Sybil protection
- Validator registration and unregistration
- Basic fees

## Third drop
