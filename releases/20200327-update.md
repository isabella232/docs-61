# It’s the end of Q1 as we know it...

Update Friday March 27, 2020

The tech team at Radix has just completed its second three-week sprint.  We are all quite happy with our progress at this early stage, but at the same time there is still quite a way to go until the first public release.

What we have so far, at a high level:
- Initial implementation of chained, 3-phase BFT consensus (unsharded Cerberus), with signature and quorum checks
- Integration of the Radix Engine into the consensus mechanism
- Basic mempool implementation
- Basic explorer (for testing)
- Basic desktop wallet and supporting Javascript library
- Java library updates for new consensus

We have not had to reduce scope on any planned functionality at this point.

The combination of these key features is getting us close to completion of Drop 1. These features will now allow us to start executing on our extensive system test program, which to date has been largely in planning and preparation.  On completion of those planned tests, we will declare “Drop 1” complete which will be an important milestone toward RPN-1 that we’ll have more to talk about.

Priorities for our next couple of sprints are:
- Make sure planned system tests work as expected against the functionality we have implemented in order to complete Drop 1
- Implement ledger synchronisation to accommodate crashing or late joining nodes for Drop 2
- Complete planning and design for our PoS implementation for Drop 2
